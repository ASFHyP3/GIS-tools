`asf_tools` is a Python package for working with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data.
It was designed for working with datasets generated by
[HyP3](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/), but several of the tools have the
potential to be used with a variety of rasters, including non-SAR datasets.


## Install

`asf_tools` can be installed via [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html):

```
conda install -c conda-forge asf_tools
```

Or using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/asf_tools/):

```
python -m pip install asf_tools
```

## Quick Usage

### Local Resolution Weighted Composite

The `make_composite` tool allows you to create a local-resolution-weighted composite from a set of Sentinel-1 RTC
products ([D. Small, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350465)). It is intended to be used with RTC products generated by [ASF HyP3](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/using/vertex).

You will need to request RTC products using the `Include Scattering Area` option, then download and unzip them into an empty directory.

To generate a composite of the co-polarization images, navigate to the directory containing the unzipped RTC products and run:
```
make_composite composite.tif */*VV.tif
```

To generate a composite of the cross-polarization images, navigate to the directory containing the unzipped RTC products and run:
```
make_composite composite.tif */*VH.tif
```
