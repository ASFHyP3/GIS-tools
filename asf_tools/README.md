`asf_tools` is a Python package for working with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data.
It was designed for working with datasets generated by
[HyP3](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/), but several of the tools have the
potential to be used with a variety of rasters, including non-SAR datasets.


## Install

`asf_tools` can be installed via [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html):

```
conda install -c conda-forge asf_tools
```

Or using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/asf_tools/):

```
python -m pip install asf_tools
```

## Quick Usage

### Local Resolution Weighted Composite

The Mosaic Tool allows you to create a local-resolution-weighted composite from a set of Sentinel-1 RTC
products (D. Small, 2012). It is intended to be used with products generated by ASF Hyp3 (learn how to get RTC by [Using HyP3 in Vertex](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/using/vertex))

After requesting RTC Products for your area of interest, download and unzip them into an empty directory.

To generate a composite of your products, run one of the following commands from the directory you unzipped the products into.

To get a composite of the dual vertical polarization image.
```
make_composite composite.tif */*VV.tif
```

To get a composite of the cross polarized image.
```
make_composite composite.tif */*VH.tif
```
