# ArcGIS Toolbox
This directory consists of the toolbox code (ASF_Tools.pyt) and xml metadata files for the toolbox as a whole and each individual tool.

- Each tool included in the toolbox is a separate class in the .pyt file
- The xml files must not be renamed; the base name must match the filename of the toolbox code followed by the tool name
- To use the toolbox, download the .pyt file and all of the .xml files and keep them in the same directory
